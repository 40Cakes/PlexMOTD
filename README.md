# PlexMOTD

![PlexMOTD](https://i.imgur.com/9Yk0ZBX.png)

I created these MOTD scripts so that I could see my Plex & Transmission statistics at a glance when I login to my server.
This is running on Ubuntu 16.04, and the scripts are split into manageable chunks.

Don't forget to add your credentials for config.conf!

Note: this was a quick hack effort, I didn't put a whole lot of effort into making the MOTD fast/efficient. I am relatively new to bash scripting so I'm sure there are better ways to do what I'm doing (this was me learning/having some fun). Let me know if you have any feedback/suggestions to make these scripts better, always looking to improve!

I get the torrent stats from Transmission, and I am using Tautulli (PlexPy) API to get the Plex stream stats. I have also removed my API keys and credentials.

If you would like any clarification on any commands/API calls that I am using, feel free to comment or PM me :)
